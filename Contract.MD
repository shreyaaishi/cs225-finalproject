Team Contract (shreyab4-dsikli2-ezhan292)  
### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Thursday at 3 PM using Discord. During each meeting,
we'll update the team Google Docs with what we need to do for the upcoming week, time-stamped for each meeting.
2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through Discord. Outside
of emergencies or other commitments, we can commit repsonding to texts within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred,
it is not required. Decisions documented in the group meeting document. By signing this document, each member 
of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.
### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined
by the full team and each member must work on one or more deliverables. If this leads to an unbalanced workload 
for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.
2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to
independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist
with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or
programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked –
politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such
as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team
members.
3. **Conflict Resolution** If one member is unhappy with some aspect the project, bring up as soon as possible. If nothing can be agreed upon, we will 
use a random number generator to decide the outcome.
